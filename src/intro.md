# Introduction

rustic is a fast and secure backup program. In the following sections, we will
present typical workflows, starting with installing, preparing a new repository,
and making the first backup.

**Note**: Parts of this documentation are shamelessly copied from the restic
documentation and then adapted to rustic as most workflows work in rustic
exactly like restic. See also the
[restic documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io) for more information about
restic.
