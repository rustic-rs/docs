# Introduction

Rustic is a fast and secure backup program. In the following sections, we will
present typical workflows, starting with installing, preparing a new repository,
and making the first backup.

Note that this documentation is shamelessly copied from the restic documentation
and then adapted to rustic as most workflows work in rustic exactly like restic.
See also the [restic documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io) for more
information about restic.
