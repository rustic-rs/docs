# Copying snapshots between repositories

In case you want to transfer snapshots between two repositories, for example
from a local to a remote repository, you can use the `copy` command:

```console
$ rustic copy --target target-profile
repository d6504c63 opened successfully, password is correct
repository 3dd0878c opened successfully, password is correct

snapshot 410b18a2 of [/home/user/work] at 2020-06-09 23:15:57.305305 +0200 CEST)
    copy started, this may take a while...
snapshot 7a746a07 saved

snapshot 4e5d5487 of [/home/user/work] at 2020-05-01 22:44:07.012113 +0200 CEST)
skipping snapshot 4e5d5487, was already copied to snapshot 50eb62b7
```

The example command copies all snapshots from the source repository
`/srv/rustic-repo` to the destination repository `/srv/rustic-repo-copy`.
Snapshots which have previously been copied between repositories will be skipped
by later copy runs.

**Important**: This process will have to both download (read) and upload (write)
the entire snapshot(s) due to the different encryption keys used in the source
and destination repository. This *may incur higher bandwidth usage and costs*
than expected during normal backup runs.
